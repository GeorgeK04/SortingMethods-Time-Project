An array of integers is created - dynamically - the size of which will be chosen by the user. 
   A menu of panel initialization options will then appear: 
1)100% random (random values) 
2)50% sorted, 50% random (50% sorted, 50% random values) 
3)Sorted ASC (ascending) 
4)Sorted DESC (sorted in descending order) 
  After the user selects, the table will be initialized with the corresponding values and sorted by the following methods: 
1) of the bubble (Bubble Sort) 
2) the direct selection (Select Sort) 
3) direct input (Insert Sort) 
4) Quick Sort For each sorting method separately, the total execution time of the algorithm will be calculated – in seconds – using the clock() function. 
    The times will be recorded by the program in an output text file named TIMES.TXT.
